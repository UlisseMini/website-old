ATTENTION. BY ILLEGALLY HACKING INTO THE DARK_WEB_CACHE FULL OF ILLICIT_WARES WHICH HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY BLACKLISTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND STORING THESE CRITICAL_ASSETS ON YOUR DEVICE, YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY AGREED TO ALLOW YOUR DEVICE TO BECOME A CRITICAL NODE IN THE SKAIANET SYSTEMS BLOCKCHAIN. TO REMOVE YOUR SYSTEM FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN, THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED PRECISELY. AT EXACTLY 04:13 UTC, DELETE CRITICAL_ASSET01.jpg. DELETION MUST OCCUR WITHIN NO GREATER OR LESS THAN ONE SECOND FROM THAT TIME. EXACTLY 24 HOURS LATER, DELETE THE SECOND CRITICAL_ASSET AT THE SAME TIME. CONTINUE DELETING EACH CONSECUTIVE CRITICAL_ASSET EVERY 24 HOURS UNTIL ALL HAVE BEEN DELETED, AND THEN 24 HOURS AFTER THAT, DELETE THE FOLDER, INCLUDING THIS READ ME FILE. ANY DEVIATION FROM THESE INSTRUCTIONS, SUCH AS DELETING A FILE AT THE WRONG TIME, WILL RESULT IN FAILURE, AND YOUR DEVICE WILL REMAIN EMBEDDED IN THE BLOCKCHAIN UNTIL YOU REINSTALL THIS CACHE OF CRITICAL_ASSETS AND START THE UNINSTALLATION PROCESS OVER. SKAIANET SYSTEMS THANKS YOU FOR GENEROUSLY PROVIDING MOST OF YOUR DEVICE'S COMPUTING POWER TO THE BLOCKCHAIN.
